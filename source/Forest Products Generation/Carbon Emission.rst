Forest Carbon Flux (Carbon Emmission)
***************************************************
The FCD products are reclassified into majorly 2 classes annually. The classified product (Forest and Non Forest areas) are then computed for difference (Deforestation or afforestation) between the two time periods. 
Carbon fluxes provide information on estimates of of carbon transferred from the above ground pool to the atmosphere or the reverse (sequestration) when afforestation/reforestation occurs.
The above ground biomass (AGB) stocks in the Tropical Forests of the IGAD region are estimated based on the 2006 IPCC guidelines (Table 4.7 of Chapter 4 Forestland) for Tropical rainforests which estimates AGB at 310 Mg Biomass/ha. Using the methodological guidelines from IPCC, this is converted to 145.7 Mg Carbon/ha (A carbon factor of 0.47 is used) and translates to 534 Mg CO2eq/ha (the molecular formula of CO2 is used). 
Based on the above Emission Factor, and the deforested forest areas (Activity Data) between two time intervals, Emission estimates (E) are computed as shown in the formula below.

Based on the above estimations, the deforested forest areas are computed per hectare annually, and then multiplied by the 
estmated carbon density value as shown in the fomular below.

.. math::
 E=AD*EF	 
 :label: eq_d

With AD being the change of forest caover in hectares (Deforestation - AD) and the reference value of 
carbon stock density per hectare in tropical forests (EF â€“ Reference Value (Integer)).

The FCD products are reclassified into majorly 2 classes annually.
The classified product (Forest and Non Forest areas) are then computed for difference between the 2.
The difference is tranlated into loss per hectare per year, to generate the amount of carbon flux in a specific years.
The figure below shows the classification table for the FCD products.
