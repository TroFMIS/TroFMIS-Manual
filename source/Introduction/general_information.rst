General Information
=====================
TrofMIS is a surveillance system that is based on monitoring the Tropical Montane Forest in the IGAD region. The Tropical montane monitoring is part of the global goal for reducing carbon emissions from the forestry sector and consequently reducing climate change. The TrofMIS is keen on applying the REDD+ monitoring guidelines outlined by UNFCCC/IPCC for tropical forests to yield these products.

	- Forest cover status (tree cover density mask for a reference year 2015) maps
	- Forest cover change (annual change 2016-2020) maps
	- Forest canopy disturbance alert (using both optical and active sensors)
	- TrofMIS generation/derivation of RADAR Forest Cover Loss Alerts, Tree Cover Density, Forest Canopy Disturbance Monitoring products on selected tropical forests for REDD+ reporting once new data is availableTraining materials (user manual) on the developments of the data acquisition, analysis and generation of final products.
	
The goal is to support the various key players in REDD+ implementation at local and national levels identify spatial and temporal patterns of deforestation and their effects of Carbon fluxes, which supports quantification of effects of drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and activities of enhancing forest carbon stocks.

Aknowledgement
--------------
Special appreciation to the `ICPAC <https://www.icpac.net/>`_ team for the great support in validation of the outputs as well as 
contribution to refine the methodologies. 
Appreciation to the countries patners who were part of the great work in providing feedback on the products generated.
The `JRC <https://www.icpac.net/>`_ team provided good reference in developing the forest products for visualisation as well as a 
base reference for more so forest monitoring alerts using Sentinel 2 sensors.
